# Javascript-WalletLink
 A pure javascript CDN accessable library for use Coinwallet SDK.  The build file found in the build folder will be able to by copied to your CDN that you choose or placed on the local server.  In javascript you can access the library with    const coinbaseWallet = new CoinbaseWalletSDK()   

 When coping the build folder, I recommend that a build number that matches the coinbaseWalletSDK such as 3.0.1/wallet-sdk-bundle.js  This will allow you to test different versions of the build before applying to production.
